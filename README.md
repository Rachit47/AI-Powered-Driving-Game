# AI-Powered-Driving-Game
'Manual' and 'AI Mode' are the two game modes available in this simple game. The player can use the arrow keys to navigate through traffic if they want to drive manually. When in AI mode, the car is operated by ANN. If a vehicle strikes a road border or moving traffic, the player loses. If the vehicle successfully navigates the whole traffic flow, the player wins.
The car's sensor rays have been used as inputs for an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm that controls the vehicle in AI mode.
ANN algorithm is optimised using a simple mutation algorithm with random initial weights and biases between -1 and 1.
In the future, a better optimisation technique may be applied to increase the vehicle's AI mode accuracy.
