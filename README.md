# AI-Powered-Driving-Game
#### 1. This basic game contains 2 modes: 'Manual' and 'AI'.The player can use the arrow keys to navigate through traffic if they want to drive manually. 
#### 2. When in AI mode, the car is operated by ANN. If a vehicle strikes a road border or moving traffic, the player loses. If the vehicle successfully navigates the whole traffic flow, the player wins.
#### 3. The car's sensor rays have been used as inputs for an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm that controls the vehicle in AI mode.
#### 4. ANN algorithm is optimised using a simple mutation algorithm with random initial weights and biases between -1 and 1.
#### 5. In the future, a better optimisation technique may be applied to increase the vehicle's AI mode accuracy.
